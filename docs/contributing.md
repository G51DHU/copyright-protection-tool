## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.

1. Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
2. Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive commit message.
3. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
4. Submit a pull request to the main repository.

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Submitting Changes

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
3. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Check the issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. If not, create a new issue, providing a clear title and description.
3. Include as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Suggesting Enhancements

1. Check the issue tracker to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
2. If not, create a new issue, clearly describing the enhancement and its potential benefits.
3. Provide examples of how the enhancement would be used, if possible.

## Development Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/G51DHU/copyright-protection-tool.git`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
  - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Install development dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

## Testing
