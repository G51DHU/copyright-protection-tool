## Project Overview

The Copyright Protection Tool is designed to index and monitor content across various web platforms to identify potential copyright infringements. The project is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of new indexers for different websites.

### Current Status

[Provide a brief overview of the project's current state, major features, and any ongoing work.]

### Future Plans

1. Please see `english_public_trackers.json` for a list of trackers that this project aims to incorporate.


## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/copyright-protection-tool.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Environment Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8 for Python code style. Please ensure your code adheres to these standards:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- Keep lines to a maximum of 100 characters.
- Use type hints where possible.

We recommend using tools like `flake8` and `black` to check and format your code.

## Adding a New Indexer

1. Refer to `indexers/indexer_template_readme.md` for detailed instructions.
2. Create a new file in the `indexers/` directory based on `indexer_template.py`.
3. Implement the required functions: `process_page`, `process_item_details`, and modify `main` as needed.
4. Add appropriate error handling and logging.
5. Update `supported_indexes.json` with the configuration for your new indexer.
6. Add tests for your indexer in the `tests/` directory.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for any new functionality you add.
- Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting your changes.
- To run tests: `python -m unittest discover tests`

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
2. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
3. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or request features.
- Clearly describe the issue or feature, including steps to reproduce for bugs.
- Check if the issue or feature request already exists before submitting.
