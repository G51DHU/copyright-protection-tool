# Copyright Protection Tool

## Introduction

The Copyright Protection Tool is a system designed to index and monitor content across various web platforms to identify potential copyright infringements. It employs web scraping techniques to gather data from multiple sources, process it, and store the results for further analysis.

## Project Goals

1. Scan popular torrenting sites
2. Create an index of torrents
3. Compare against an index of copyrighted content
4. Provide a detailed breakdown of potential copyright breaches

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/G51DHU/copyright-protection-tool.git
   cd copyright-protection-tool
   ```

2. Set up and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
