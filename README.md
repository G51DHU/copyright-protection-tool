# Copyright Protection Tool

## Introduction

The Copyright Protection Tool is a system designed to index and monitor content across various web platforms to identify potential copyright infringements. It employs web scraping techniques to gather data from multiple sources, process it, and store the results for further analysis.

Please note this is a the short README.md if you wish to see a more detailed README, and more information regaring the scope and workflows, please refer to documentation within the `"/docs"` folder.

## Project Goals

1. Scan popular torrenting sites
2. Create an index of torrents
3. Compare against an index of copyrighted content
4. Provide a detailed breakdown of potential copyright breaches

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/G51DHU/copyright-protection-tool.git
   cd copyright-protection-tool
   ```

2. Set up and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the tool by editing `config/config.json` and `config/supported_indexes.json`.

5. Run the tool:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Potential Use Cases & Real-World Applications

1. Copyright Enforcement: Media companies can use this tool to automatically scan popular torrent sites for unauthorized distribution of their content, including leaked footage, scripts, or unreleased music tracks.

2. Brand and Product Protection: Businesses can monitor for unauthorized use or distribution of their proprietary software, digital products, or trademarks. This extends to identifying counterfeit products and unauthorized resellers.

3. Academic Integrity: Educational institutions could adapt this tool to check for potential plagiarism or unauthorized sharing of course materials.

4. Legal Evidence Gathering: Law firms specializing in intellectual property could use this tool to gather evidence of copyright infringement for their cases.

5. Market Analysis and Content Monetization: Content creators could use the tool to understand how and where their work is being distributed, potentially informing marketing strategies, identifying new markets, or discovering new monetization opportunities.

6. Compliance Monitoring: Organizations can ensure their own digital assets are not being inappropriately shared by employees or partners. ISPs could also use it to monitor compliance with copyright laws and acceptable use policies.

7. Research and Policy Evaluation: Academics studying digital piracy trends and policymakers evaluating copyright laws could use this tool to gather data on the prevalence and patterns of copyright infringement.

8. Digital Rights Management (DRM) Effectiveness: Content distributors could assess the effectiveness of their DRM systems by monitoring how quickly and widely protected content appears on unauthorized platforms after release.

9. Protecting Unreleased Content: Film, TV, music, and game development companies could monitor for leaks of unreleased content, beta versions, or unauthorized copies prior to official release dates.

10. E-book and Digital Publication Protection: Publishers could monitor for unauthorized distribution of e-books and other digital publications.

11. Competitive Intelligence: Companies could monitor for leaks of their competitors' proprietary information or upcoming product details.

12. Insurance Risk Assessment: Insurers offering intellectual property insurance could use the tool to assess risk levels for different types of digital content.

Remember, while this tool can be powerful for identifying potential copyright infringements and other unauthorized uses of digital content, it should always be used responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Some of these applications may require additional legal consideration or adaptation of the tool's capabilities.

## Disclaimer

Important: All code in this project has been written entirely by the human developer. No AI was involved in generating any part of the codebase.

The documentation you are reading was generated with the assistance of an AI language model (Claude, developed by Anthropic), based on descriptions of the project provided by the developer. While the content has been reviewed and edited for accuracy and relevance to the Copyright Protection Tool project, users should be aware that an AI was involved in creating the documentation text.

The core concepts and feature descriptions in this documentation are based on the actual implementation of the Copyright Protection Tool. However, the language and structure of the documentation were significantly influenced by the AI's output. As with any automatically generated content, users are encouraged to critically evaluate the information and always refer to the actual codebase for the most up-to-date and accurate details about the tool's functionality.

If you notice any inconsistencies between this documentation and the actual code, or have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contribute or raise an issue in the project repository.

Remember: The code is human-written; only this documentation text was AI-assisted.
